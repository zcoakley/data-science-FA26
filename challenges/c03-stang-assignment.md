*Purpose*: When designing structures such as bridges, boats, and planes,
the design team needs data about *material properties*. Often when we
engineers first learn about material properties through coursework, we
talk about abstract ideas and look up values in tables without ever
looking at the data that gave rise to published properties. In this
challenge you’ll study an aluminum alloy dataset: Studying these data
will give you a better sense of the challenges underlying published
material values.

In this challenge, you will load a real dataset, wrangle it into tidy
form, and perform EDA to learn more about the data.

# Grading Rubric

<!-- -------------------------------------------------- -->

Unlike exercises, **challenges will be graded**. The following rubrics
define how you will be graded, both on an individual and team basis.

## Individual

<!-- ------------------------- -->

| Category | Needs Improvement | Satisfactory |
|----|----|----|
| Effort | Some task **q**’s left unattempted | All task **q**’s attempted |
| Observed | Did not document observations, or observations incorrect | Documented correct observations based on analysis |
| Supported | Some observations not clearly supported by analysis | All observations clearly supported by analysis (table, graph, etc.) |
| Assessed | Observations include claims not supported by the data, or reflect a level of certainty not warranted by the data | Observations are appropriately qualified by the quality & relevance of the data and (in)conclusiveness of the support |
| Specified | Uses the phrase “more data are necessary” without clarification | Any statement that “more data are necessary” specifies which *specific* data are needed to answer what *specific* question |
| Code Styled | Violations of the [style guide](https://style.tidyverse.org/) hinder readability | Code sufficiently close to the [style guide](https://style.tidyverse.org/) |

*Background*: In 1946, scientists at the Bureau of Standards tested a
number of Aluminum plates to determine their
[elasticity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elastic_modulus) and
[Poisson’s ratio](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poisson%27s_ratio).
These are key quantities used in the design of structural members, such
as aircraft skin under [buckling
loads](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buckling). These scientists tested
plats of various thicknesses, and at different angles with respect to
the [rolling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rolling_(metalworking))
direction.

# Loading and Wrangle

<!-- -------------------------------------------------- -->

The `readr` package in the Tidyverse contains functions to load data
form many sources. The `read_csv()` function will help us load the data
for this challenge.

``` r
## NOTE: If you extracted all challenges to the same location,
## you shouldn't have to change this filename
filename <- "./data/stang.csv"

## Load the data
df_stang <- read_csv(filename)
```

    ## Rows: 9 Columns: 8
    ## ── Column specification ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
    ## Delimiter: ","
    ## chr (1): alloy
    ## dbl (7): thick, E_00, nu_00, E_45, nu_45, E_90, nu_90
    ## 
    ## ℹ Use `spec()` to retrieve the full column specification for this data.
    ## ℹ Specify the column types or set `show_col_types = FALSE` to quiet this message.

``` r

Note that these data are not tidy! The data in this form are convenient
for reporting in a table, but are not ideal for analysis.

### **q1** Tidy `df_stang` to produce `df_stang_long`. You should have column names `thick, alloy, angle, E, nu`. Make sure the `angle` variable is of correct type. Filter out any invalid values.

*Hint*: You can reshape in one `pivot` using the `".value"` special
value for `names_to`.

``` r
## TASK: Tidy `df_stang`
df_stang_long <-
  df_stang %>%
  pivot_longer(
    cols = starts_with("E") | starts_with("nu"),
    names_to = c(".value", "angle"),
    names_sep = "_"
  ) %>%
  mutate(angle = as.integer(angle)) %>%
  filter(E != -1, nu != -1)

df_stang_long
```

    ## # A tibble: 26 × 5

**Observations**:

- Is there “one true value” for the material properties of Aluminum?
  - No. At different thicknesses and angles, the stiffness varies
    between 9900 and 10700 and poisson’s ratio varies between 0.31 and
    0.331, indicating that these values can vary based on properties of
    the aluminum, unless this is just due to random variation.
- How many aluminum alloys are in this dataset? How do you know?
  - Just one. When I created a summary of the data, it says “N.unique :
    1” under the alloy, indicating there is only one unique value in
    that column.
- What angles were tested?
  - 0, 45, and 90 degrees from the rolling direction
- What thicknesses were tested?
  - 0.022, 0.032, 0.064, and 0.081 inches
- How does the angle of the piece of aluminum relative to the rolling
  direction affect the stiffness and poisson’s ratio of the aluminum?

## Visualize

<!-- ------------------------- -->

### **q3** Create a visualization to investigate your question from q2 above. Can you find an answer to your question using the dataset? Would you need additional information to answer your question?

``` r
## TASK: Investigate your question from q1 here
df_stang_long %>%
  ggplot(mapping = aes(x = factor(angle), y = E)) +
  geom_boxplot()
```

![](c03-stang-assignment_files/figure-gfm/q3-task-1.png)<!-- -->

``` r
df_stang_long %>%
  ggplot(mapping = aes(x = factor(angle), y = nu)) +
  geom_boxplot()
```

![](c03-stang-assignment_files/figure-gfm/unnamed-chunk-1-1.png)<!-- -->

**Observations**:

- It does not seem like the angle at which the piece is cut relative to
  the roll angle affects the stiffness of the aluminum. The median value
  of E (stiffness) for each angle is very similar relative to the size
  of the interquartile range for each angle.
- It seems more plausible that the Poisson’s ratio of the aluminum is
  affected by the angle it is cut at since the box for the 45 degree
  angle is visually higher than the boxes for 0 and 90 degrees. However,
  there is still a lot of variation in Poisson’s ratio within each angle
  (the ranges for each angle are very similar), so I think it would be
  helpful to see more data points for this measurement, or doing the
  experiment over and finding a way to more tightly control variation
  variables that might affect the Poisson’s ratio, such as the cut
  angle, thickness, amount of force being applied. If the 45 degree
  angle continues to have a higher Poisson’s ratio than the 0 and 90
  degree angles after doing that, we could be more confident that that
  is due to an actual property of the aluminum and not just spurious.

### **q4** Consider the following statement:

> “A material’s property (or material property) is an intensive property
> of some material, i.e. a physical property that does not depend on the
> amount of the material.”\[2\]

Note that the “amount of material” would vary with the thickness of a
tested plate. Does the following graph support or contradict the claim
that “elasticity `E` is an intensive material property.” Why or why not?
Is this evidence *conclusive* one way or another? Why or why not?

``` r
## NOTE: No need to change; run this chunk
df_stang_long %>%

  ggplot(aes(nu, E, color = as_factor(thick))) +
  geom_point(size = 3) +
  theme_minimal()
```

![](c03-stang-assignment_files/figure-gfm/q4-vis-1.png)<!-- -->

**Observations**:

- Does this graph support or contradict the claim above?
  - It would appear to contradict that claim because on this graph as
    the thickness gets smaller, both the elasticity and Poisson’s ratio
    get larger.
- Is this evidence *conclusive* one way or another?
  - I don’t think it’s conclusive. I don’t know a lot about material
    properties, but it seems plausible to me that something about the
    process of creating different material thicknesses also could affect
    its elasticity or how much thinner it gets when stretched. This is
    also just one study, and it probably doesn’t make sense to
    conclusively say that elasticity is not an intensive material
    property just based on one study’s results. I would want to see
    replication of this result as well as some other methods for
    measuring elasticity and see if those results also contradict the
    claim.
- One more thought on this was that I threw away one data point at the
  beginning of this exercise. This is a small dataset, so that might
  matter. The data point I threw out was on a 0.081 thickness plate cut
  at a 45 degree angle. From answering my question earlier about whether
  the angle affect elasticity and poisson’s ratio, I saw that the 45
  degree angle had a higher value for the poisson’s ratio than the 0 and
  90 degree angles. So since the 0.081 data is missing one of those 45
  degree angle data points, that might explain why it appear to have a
  lower elasticity and poisson’s ratio in this plot.
