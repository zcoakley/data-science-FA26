# Libraries
library(tidyverse)
library(googlesheets4)

url <- "https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1av_SXn4j0-4Rk0mQFik3LLr-uf0YdA06i3ugE6n-Zdo/edit?usp=sharing"

# Parameters
LIGHTSPEED_VACUUM    <- 299792.458 # Exact speed of light in a vacuum (km / s)
LIGHTSPEED_MICHELSON <- 299944.00  # Michelson's speed estimate (km / s)
LIGHTSPEED_PM        <- 51         # Michelson error estimate (km / s)
```

*Background*: In 1879 Albert Michelson led an experimental campaign to
measure the speed of light. His approach was a development upon the
method of Foucault\[3\], and resulted in a new estimate of
$v_0 = 299944 \pm 51$ kilometers per second (in a vacuum). This is very
close to the modern *exact* value of 2.9979246^{5}. In this challenge,
you will analyze Michelson’s original data, and explore some of the
factors associated with his experiment.

I’ve already copied Michelson’s data from his 1880 publication; the code
chunk below will load these data from a public googlesheet.

*Aside*: The speed of light is *exact* (there is **zero error** in the
value `LIGHTSPEED_VACUUM`) because the meter is actually
[*defined*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metre#Speed_of_light_definition)
in terms of the speed of light!

### **q1** Re-create the following table (from Michelson (1880), pg. 139) using `df_michelson` and `dplyr`. Note that your values *will not* match those of Michelson *exactly*; why might this be?

| Distinctness | n   | MeanVelocity |
|--------------|-----|--------------|
| 3            | 46  | 299860       |
| 2            | 39  | 299860       |

``` r
## TODO: Compute summaries
df_q1 <- df_michelson %>%
  group_by(Distinctness) %>%
  summarise(
    n = n(),
    MeanVelocity = mean(Velocity)
  ) %>%
  ungroup()

df_q1 %>%
  arrange(desc(Distinctness)) %>%
  knitr::kable()
```

| Distinctness |   n | MeanVelocity |
|:-------------|----:|-------------:|
| 3            |  46 |     299861.7 |
| 2            |  39 |     299858.5 |
| 1            |  15 |     299808.0 |

**Observations**:

Write your observations here!

- I wonder how the distinctness categories are determined. Is that
  Michelson’s qualitative judgement of how distinct the images are?

- Michelson’s computed mean velocity of the speed of light is the same
  for images with distinctness levels of good and fair, but a little
  lower for poor distinctness images.

- All three computed mean velocity values are higher than the actual
  speed of light in a vacuum, but not by a lot.

- There are more images with good and fair distinctness than poor
  distinctness.

Why might your table differ from Michelson’s?

- It looks like Michelson might have rounded his velocity values to the
  tens place. He might have done that because of significant figures so
  that the computed mean velocity values expressed an appropriate amount
  of precision.

The `Velocity` values in the dataset are the speed of light *in air*;
Michelson introduced a couple of adjustments to estimate the speed of
light in a vacuum. In total, he added $+92$ km/s to his mean estimate
for `VelocityVacuum` (from Michelson (1880), pg. 141). While the
following isn’t fully rigorous ($+92$ km/s is based on the mean
temperature), we’ll simply apply this correction to all the observations
in the dataset.

### **q2** Create a new variable `VelocityVacuum` with the $+92$ km/s adjustment to `Velocity`. Assign this new dataframe to `df_q2`.

``` r
## TODO: Adjust the data, assign to df_q2
df_q2 <- df_michelson %>%
  mutate(VelocityVacuum = Velocity + 92)

As part of his study, Michelson assessed the various potential sources
of error, and provided his best-guess for the error in his
speed-of-light estimate. These values are provided in
`LIGHTSPEED_MICHELSON`—his nominal estimate—and
`LIGHTSPEED_PM`—plus/minus bounds on his estimate. Put differently,
Michelson believed the true value of the speed-of-light probably lay
between `LIGHTSPEED_MICHELSON - LIGHTSPEED_PM` and
`LIGHTSPEED_MICHELSON + LIGHTSPEED_PM`.

Let’s introduce some terminology:\[2\]

- **Error** is the difference between a true value and an estimate of
  that value; for instance `LIGHTSPEED_VACUUM - LIGHTSPEED_MICHELSON`.
- **Uncertainty** is an analyst’s *assessment* of the error.

Since a “true” value is often not known in practice, one generally does
not know the error. The best they can do is quantify their degree of
uncertainty. We will learn some means of quantifying uncertainty in this
class, but for many real problems uncertainty includes some amount of
human judgment.\[2\]

### **q3** Compare Michelson’s speed of light estimate against the modern speed of light value. Is Michelson’s estimate of the error (his uncertainty) greater or less than the true error?

``` r
## TODO: Compare Michelson's estimate and error against the true value
## Your code here!
true_error <- abs(LIGHTSPEED_VACUUM - LIGHTSPEED_MICHELSON)

paste("True Error:", true_error)
```

    ## [1] "True Error: 151.542000000016"

``` r
paste("Michelson's Error Estimate:", LIGHTSPEED_PM)
```

    ## [1] "Michelson's Error Estimate: 51"

**Observations**: - Is Michelson’s estimate of the error (his
uncertainty) greater or less than the true error?

- His true error is greater than his estimate of his error.

Make a quantitative comparison between Michelson’s uncertainty and his
error.

- Michelson’s true error was about three times greater than his
  uncertainty.

The following plot shows all of Michelson’s data as a [control
chart](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Control_chart); this sort of plot
is common in manufacturing, where it is used to help determine if a
manufacturing process is under [statistical
control](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_process_control).
Each dot is one of Michelson’s measurements, and the grey line connects
the mean taken for each day. The same plot also shows simulated data
using a probability model. We’ll get into statistics later in the
course; for now, let’s focus on understanding what real and simulated
data tend to look like.

### **q4** Inspect the following plot with the `Real` Michelson data and `Simulated` data from a probability model. Document the similarities and differences between the data under *observe* below.

**Observations**:

Similarities -

- Both the real and simulated data have many individual point
  measurements outside of Michelson’s uncertainty bounds.

- The vast majority of the real and simulation data points are above the
  real value for the speed of light, suggesting that the measurement
  error is due to a flaw in the measurement process rather than just
  statistical noise.

Differences -

- The real data seems to have some outliers that are further from the
  mean than the simulated data. The furthest point from the mean in the
  simulated data is under 200 km/s away from the mean, while the real
  data has three points that are more than 200 km/s above the mean.

- The real data appears to have less variability and large outliers
  towards the end of the experiment than towards the beginning, while
  the simulated data seems more consistent the whole time.

### **q5** You have access to a few other variables. Construct a **at least three** visualizations of `VelocityVacuum` against these other factors. Are there other patterns in the data that might help explain the difference between Michelson’s estimate and `LIGHTSPEED_VACUUM`?

``` r
df_q2 %>%
  ggplot(aes(
    x = Temp,
    y = VelocityVacuum
  )) +
  geom_point()
```

![](c02-michelson-assignment_files/figure-gfm/unnamed-chunk-2-1.png)<!-- -->

Observations:

- It looks like there is a positive correlation between temperature and
  Michelson’s calculated velocity value. This suggests that he didn’t
  properly account for temperature in his adjustments.
- Looking at the original paper, it looks like he made a calculation for
  how much to adjust the final velocity value based on the average
  temperature from all of the times he collected data, then adjusted all
  of the final velocity values by his calculated adjustment value. Given
  that this plot shows a correlation between temperature and the final
  velocity value, I think it would be better to calculate the adjustment
  for each data point based on its individual temperature measurement.
  Although maybe it doesn’t matter if he is averaging all of the
  velocity measurements anyway to get his final measurement of the speed
  of light.

``` r
df_q2 %>%
  ggplot(aes(
    x = Date,
    y = VelocityVacuum
  )) +
  geom_point()
```

![](c02-michelson-assignment_files/figure-gfm/unnamed-chunk-3-1.png)<!-- -->

Observations:

- It seems like Michelson’s earlier measurements vary more than his
  later ones. This could be because he got better at setting up and
  calibrating his instruments over time.

``` r
df_q2 %>%
  ggplot(aes(
    x = Distinctness,
    y = VelocityVacuum
  )) +
  geom_boxplot()
```

![](c02-michelson-assignment_files/figure-gfm/unnamed-chunk-4-1.png)<!-- -->

Observations:

- The median velocity increases with the image distinctness. I’m not
  sure what would be causing this, but I think it would suggest that
  there is some factor affecting the distinctness that also affects the
  measured velocity, and it would be worth looking into whether that
  factor can be controlled better.

Overall, I think the fact that Michelson’s measured speed of light
varies with both temperature and image distinctness would be good
factors to investigate and control better if this experiment were
replicated, and the effects of these variables could help explain some
of the difference between Michelson’s estimate and the real speed of
light in a vacuum.
